Hello! I'm Stewart and can generally be found on various platforms through the handle of "telestew".

I almost have a Ph.D. in Math, got a CS minor in my undergrad, and like to fiddle around in quite a lot of things.
Topology is my main jam, music is a common activity of mine, and topological data analysis seems like something I should work towards contributing to.

Web3 seems pretty promising if its popular image can get past the "pump and dump baseball card" phase. There's some pretty neat software there I'd like to get more involved with.
